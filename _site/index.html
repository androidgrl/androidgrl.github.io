        Alternatives to Using the Try method
      </a>
    </h1>

    <span class="post-date">14 Jan 2017</span>

    <p>The architect for our team said that using the try method is like introducing cancer into a code base.
One example of how try is used is:</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code>class Order
  def grand_total
    sub_total.try(:*, sales_tax)
  end

  def sub_total
    FooBar.baz
  end
end
</code></pre>
</div>

<p>Say we have a method grand_total which multiplies an order’s subtotal by the local sales_tax.
What if sub_total were nil?  If you multiiply nil by a number you get an error.  To prevent this, some people use try.  If try is called on nil, it will return nil instead of erroring out.  If it is called on an actual object then it will perform the operation as normal.</p>

<p>One reason why this is insidious is because although it seems harmless, it introduces uncertainty in the code.  It is better to know what kind of result you’re dealing with.</p>

<p>In this case, we can avoid using try with an if statement.</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code>class Order
  def grand_total
    if subtotal
      (sub_total * sales_tax)
    else
      nil
    end
  end

  def sub_total
    FooBar.baz
  end
end
</code></pre>
</div>

<p>If there’s a subtotal it will perform the multiplication, if there is not it will return nil.  Since by default nil is what is returned by else, you can take out the else and make the statement one line.</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code>class Order
  def grand_total
    (sub_total * sales_tax) if sub_total
  end

  def sub_total
    FooBar.baz
  end
end
</code></pre>
</div>

<p>What if we wanted to return 0 instead of nil if there was no sub_total?  We could go back to the if else statement but sometimes it can be better to use a Null Object pattern.</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code>class Order
  def grand_total
    sub_total * sales_tax
  end

  def sub_total
    result = FooBar.baz
    if result
      result
    else
      NullOrder.new.sub_total
    end
  end
end

class NullOrder
  def sub_total
    0
  end
end
</code></pre>
</div>

<p>Going into the sub_total method, if we get a result from FooBar.baz we return it, if it is nil then we return an instance of NullOrder which has a sub_total of 0.</p>

<p>We then no longer have to have branching inside the grand_total method.  It will either be the actual sub_total or the sub_total on the NullOrder which is 0.</p>

<p>This is an example of Duck Typing.  Duck Typing is when we don’t care what type of object we’re dealing with only that it has certain behavior.  In this case  we just care that Order and NullOrder both have a sub_total method.</p>

<p>In order to prevent an error in case someone tries to call an undefined method on the NullOrder, we can override the method_missing method to return whatever we want.  For example:</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code>class NullOrder
  def method_missing(*_args)
    nil
  end

  def sub_total
    0
  end
end
</code></pre>
</div>

<p>If someone were to call NullOrder.new.whatever, the method_missing method gets called which by default will raise an error.  Instead we override it to return nil.  We add a splat argument in case someone calls an undefined method on it that has arguments.  The underscore in  front of “args” denotes that it’s something that’s not supposed to be used.</p>

        Law of Demeter
      </a>
    </h1>

    <span class="post-date">04 Jan 2017</span>

    <p>A few times I’ve been told during code review that something violates the Law of Demeter.  This method for example.</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code>class User
  def user_info
    "#{user.name}, #{user.department.name}"
  end
end
</code></pre>
</div>

<p>Which led me to ask: what is the Law of Demeter, why should I follow it, how do I know if I’m violating it, and how do I avoid violating it?</p>

<p>The Law of Demeter is formally defined as,</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code>A method of an object may only call methods of:
  The object itself.
  An argument of the method.
  Any object created within the method.
  Any direct properties/fields of the object.
</code></pre>
</div>

<p>The above code sample violates the law with “user.department.name” because it’s calling name on the user’s department, and department is an entirely different object from a user.</p>

<p>In general it is better if one class does not have to know about methods from another class, in other words when the classes are “decoupled”.  This is because it makes the code more flexible.  For example in our code sample, there is only one department for a user.  But what happens if things changed so that a user could have many departments and we wanted the only use the first one for our user_info method?  We would then have to say:</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code>class User
  def user_info
    "#{user.name}, #{user.departments.first.name}"
  end
end
</code></pre>
</div>

<p>This seems reasonable for now but what if we used “user.department” in multiple places?  We’d have to make the same change wherever it was used, which would be cumbersome.</p>

<p>So how do you avoid violating the law?</p>

<p>You could make a custom method in the User class called “department_name”:</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code>class User
  def user_info
    "#{user.name}, #{user.department_name}"
  end

  def department_name
    departments.first.name
  end
end
</code></pre>
</div>

<p>Now the department_name is an immediate property of the user itself, satisfying the law and also making it easier to make future changes if we want to change what we use for the department’s name.</p>

<p>One sign that is often but not always an indication of Demeter violation is chaining of dots.  For example “user.departments.first.name” had chained dots and indeed was a violation.  However, sometimes dot chaining does not mean Demeter violation for example:</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code>def slug(string)
  string.strip.downcase.tr_s('^[a-z0-9]', '-')
end
</code></pre>
</div>

<p>The above complies with the Law of Demeter because each method is called on a String object.  And the law doesn’t care about the number of methods called, but the number of <em>types</em> of methods called.</p>

        Refining Searches using Ag
      </a>
    </h1>

    <span class="post-date">03 Jan 2017</span>

    <p>I use Ag a lot to search for keywords in Rails Apps.  However sometimes a keyword is present so often that I want to refine my search.  One example of this is if I want to search for a keyword present only in test files. Ag has a useful -G flag that allows you to do this.</p>

<p>For example say I wanted to search for the keyword “organization” in files that end in spec.rb.  I would use:</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code>&gt; Ag organization -G spec.rb$
</code></pre>
</div>

<p>The -G flag tells Ag to look for the term inside files with names containing spec.rb.  It can accept a regex which is what the $ is for.  The $ indicates that I want to search in files that end in spec.rb, not just files that have spec.rb somewhere within their names.</p>

<p>Another example is if I am searching for a keyword that includes punctuation marks which happen to be regex characters.  For example, I was searching for “.try” and since Ag automatically treats search terms as regexes by default, it will find all terms with any character followed by try, like “retry” in addition to “.try”.</p>

<p>Ag has a literal expression flag -Q to specify that you’re searching for a literal expression not a regex.  In order to search for “.try” you would use:</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code>&gt; Ag -Q .try
</code></pre>
</div>

        How to Raise and Rescue Errors in Rails
      </a>
    </h1>

    <span class="post-date">30 Aug 2016</span>

    <p>Raising and rescuing errors in Rails is relatively easy.  All you need to do is make a custom error class, raise it (usually in a model) and rescue it (usually in a controller).</p>

<p>Start by making a custom error class that inherits from StandardError.  This will give you a more descriptive error instead of raising the generic StandardError, so you can better deduce where the error came from.
 I will use a hypothetical example of an error that is raised when a User is being created.</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code>class UserCreateError &lt; StandardError
end
</code></pre>
</div>

<p>Each custom error class should have it’s own file which you can put in an app/errors directory.</p>

<p>Here I will raise the error in a User model method.</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code>class User &lt; ActiveRecord::Base
  def self.example_method
    raise UserCreateError
  end
end
</code></pre>
</div>

<p>When the create action is called on the controller, it will call User.example_method, which will raise the error.  The error then goes back up to the controller where it is rescued.</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code>class UsersController &lt; ApplicationController
  def create
    User.example_method
  rescue UserCreateError
    render json: "Invalid User Information", status: :bad_request
  end
end
</code></pre>
</div>

<p>Note the indentation of the rescue is on the same column as the def.</p>

<p>Whatever you put underneath the rescue will be run if there is an error.</p>

<p>Here I render a custom json error message and specify an optional status code.</p>

<p>And that’s pretty much all there is too it.</p>

      <a href="//2016/07/15/initialize/">
        What is initialize used for in Ruby?
      </a>
    </h1>

    <span class="post-date">15 Jul 2016</span>

    <p>Does initialize need to be used all the time in a class?  No.
You only need it to set instance variables and to allow passing of arguments when instantiating a class.</p>

<p><strong>Example one:</strong> <em>You don’t need it to instantiate a class</em></p>

<p>Let’s make a class with a single instance method and no initialize method.</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code>class Holiday
  def statement
    "I'm going to the beach"
  end
end
puts Holiday.new
puts Holiday.new.statement
</code></pre>
</div>

<p>If we run the code, the “puts” outputs the following, and we see that Holiday.new instantiates an object just fine and we can call the method statement on it:</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code>#&lt;Holiday:0x007fe194093d00&gt;
I'm going to the beach
</code></pre>
</div>

<p><strong>Example two:</strong> <em>You don’t need it to use attr_accessors</em></p>

<p>Let’s make a class with an attr_accessor and no initialize method.  We instantiate two different holiday objects, and then using the attr_accessors set a separate location attribute for each.</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code>class Holiday
  attr_accessor :location
  def statement
    "I'm going on holiday to #{location}"
  end
end
holiday1 = Holiday.new
holiday2 = Holiday.new
holiday1.location = "Europe"
holiday2.location = "Hawaii"
puts holiday1.statement
puts holiday2.statement
</code></pre>
</div>

<p>The output shows that the attr_accessors still work without the initialize method.</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code>I'm going on holiday to Europe
I'm going on holiday to Hawaii
</code></pre>
</div>

<p><strong>Example three:</strong> <em>You DO need it to set instance variables</em></p>

<p>The following is a class that tries to set an instance variable @word to equal “whatever”.
The output is nothing, because instance variables need to be put inside an initialize method.</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code>class Random
  @word = "whatever"
  def whatever
    @word
  end
end
puts Random.new.whatever
</code></pre>
</div>

<p>The following will correctly result in an output of “whatever”.</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code>class Random
  def initialize
    @word = "whatever"
  end
  def whatever
    @word
  end
end
puts Random.new.whatever
</code></pre>
</div>

<p><strong>Example four:</strong> <em>You DO need it to allow arguments to be passed in when instantiating a Class</em></p>

<p>The following code tries to pass in a string argument into the “new” method.</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code>class Random
end

puts Random.new("whatever")
</code></pre>
</div>

<p>This results in an error.</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code>new.rb:35:in `initialize': no implicit conversion of String into Integer (TypeError)
        from new.rb:35:in `new'
        from new.rb:35:in `&lt;main&gt;'
</code></pre>
</div>

<p>You need to specify that there are arguments in the initialize method for “new” method to be able to take any.
However, you don’t have to actually do anything with the arguments in the initialize method.</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code>class Random
  def initialize(word)
  end
end

puts Random.new("whatever")
</code></pre>
</div>

<p>This will result in the object being successfully instantiated, as shown in the output below.</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code>#&lt;Random:0x007fbbb9170cd8&gt;
</code></pre>
</div>

<p>If you wanted to actually have access to the attribute then you would have to set it as an instance variable inside the initialize method, and set an attr_reader.</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code>class Random
  attr_reader :word
  def initialize(word)
    @word = word
  end
end

puts Random.new("whatever").word
</code></pre>
</div>

<p>Which will output “whatever”.</p>
