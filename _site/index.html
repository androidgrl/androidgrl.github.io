        The Namespace Resolution Operator, aka the "double colon operator"
      </a>
    </h1>

    <span class="post-date">28 Jan 2017</span>

    <p>At work I saw an interesting version of the namespace resolution operator, aka the double colon operator.  Previously I had only seen it used to gain access inside scoped modules.  Such as gaining access to the ID defined inside module B below:</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code>module A
  module B
    ID = 3
  end
end

puts A::B::ID
&gt;&gt; 3
</code></pre>
</div>

<p>But this time it was used at the beginning of a scoped chain of modules like inside module B below:</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code>module C
  ID = 3
end

module A
  module C
  ID = 4
    module B
      ID = ::C::ID
    end
  end
end

puts A::C::B::ID
&gt;&gt; 3
</code></pre>
</div>

<p>This is called the root namespace resolution operator and it specifies that you are looking for a root level module.  A root level module is one that is not scoped inside another module.  So in this case, it is the module C defined on top which has the ID of 3.</p>

<p>Why was this needed?  It was needed so that it wouldn’t find the scoped module A::C’s ID instead.  For example if we removed the root operator like below, it would return 4 instead of 3.</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code>module C
  ID = 3
end

module A
  module C
  ID = 4
    module B
      ID = C::ID
    end
  end
end

puts A::C::B::ID
&gt;&gt; 4
</code></pre>
</div>

<p>In fact, if we did not have the ID = 4 defined inside the scoped module C, it would error out and never find the root level module C ID, like below.</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code>module C
  ID = 3
end

module A
  module C
    module B
      ID = C::ID
    end
  end
end

puts A::C::B::ID
&gt;&gt; error
</code></pre>
</div>

<p>Why does the scoped A::C take precedence over the root level C in the above case?
Because when you call C::ID inside of module B, it starts from where it is inside the scope and moves outward through it’s surrounding modules.  It then finds the outer module A::C and looks for an ID there.  Because it found a module C, it stops there and does not continue even though it has no ID defined, and does not continue to look for the root module C.</p>

<p>Also it is important to note that when two modules have the same name but are scoped differently they are completely different modules.  In fact they might as well have different names.  For example below:</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code>module C
  ID = 1
end

module A
  module C
    ID = 2
  end
end

puts C::ID
&gt;&gt; 1
puts A::C::ID
&gt;&gt; 2
</code></pre>
</div>

<p>This is not to be confused with monkey patching a module, for example the code below first defines a root level module C with a constant of ONE, then it monkey patches the same root level module to add another constant TWO.  You can monkey patch a module or class as many times as you want, Ruby doesn’t care.</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code>module C
  ONE = 1
end

module C
  TWO = 2
end

puts C::ONE
&gt;&gt; 1
puts C::TWO
&gt;&gt; 2
</code></pre>
</div>

<p>However, if you tried to monkey patch into a module with the same name but on a different scoped level it would not work because they’re two entirely different modules.</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code>module C
  ONE = 1
end

module A
  module C
    TWO = 2
  end
end

puts C::TWO
&gt;&gt; error
</code></pre>
</div>

        The difference between using include and extend when including modules in a Class
      </a>
    </h1>

    <span class="post-date">19 Jan 2017</span>

    <p>We’ve seen the use of include for including methods from a module into a Class.
The following shows three modules included into Class A:</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code>module B
  def b
    :b
  end
end

module C
  def c
    :c
  end
end

module D
  def d
    :d
  end
end

class A
  include B
  include C
  include D
end
</code></pre>
</div>

<p>Include turns the methods inside the module into <em>instance</em> methods for that class:</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code>puts A.new.b &gt;&gt; b
puts A.new.c &gt;&gt; c
puts A.new.d &gt;&gt; d
</code></pre>
</div>

<p>However you can also change the methods into <em>class</em> methods by using extend:</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code>module B
  def b
    :b
  end
end

module C
  def c
    :c
  end
end

module D
  def d
    :d
  end
end

class A
  extend B
  extend C
  extend D
end

puts A.b &gt;&gt; b
puts A.c &gt;&gt; c
puts A.d &gt;&gt; d
</code></pre>
</div>

<p>Notice how we didn’t have to change the method definitions inside the module to self.method.
This is because modules have no sense of Class, they’re just buckets for methods.  They are called
‘mixins’ because they mix methods into wherever they are included or extended into.</p>

<p>Our team architect Adam Zaninovich gives the analogy of modules being ‘viruses’ and classes being ‘hosts’.  Modules ‘infect’
classes with their ‘methods’ (in a good way in this case), in the sense that viruses inject their dna into host cells.</p>

<p>I wrote include in class A three times which is repetitive.  If you find that you are
including modules in a class many times you can avoid this by using the self.included module method.</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code>module B
  def self.included(klass)
    klass.include C
    klass.include D
  end

  def b
    :b
  end
end

module C
  def c
    :c
  end
end

module D
  def d
    :d
  end
end

class A
  include B
end

puts A.new.b &gt;&gt; b
puts A.new.c &gt;&gt; c
puts A.new.d &gt;&gt; d
</code></pre>
</div>

<p>Now there is only ‘include B’ inside class A.  Whenever B is included in a Class, it calls self.included
which passes in the class A as an argument.  “self.included” then included modules C and D into the klass
passed as the argument which in our case is class A.</p>

        Alternatives to Using the Try method
      </a>
    </h1>

    <span class="post-date">14 Jan 2017</span>

    <p>At my work we have a North America team and a China team.  Part of our workflow is to review each others merge requests before merging.  As a junior developer I often see things that I have never seen before and must make an educated decision about whether the unfamiliar pattern is a genuine coding error or deviation from best practices, or just something new I don’t know about.  And because the person who wrote the code is in China in an opposite time zone, it’s not easy to ask them directly about it.  So, while reviewing an MR I saw a use of the try method that I had never seen before.  Here is a simplified version:</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code>class Order
  def grand_total
    sub_total.try(:*, sales_tax)
  end

  def sub_total
    FooBar.baz
  end
end
</code></pre>
</div>

<p>Here the asterisk is the multiplication operator.  Try is trying to multiply sub_total by sales_tax.  If sub_total is nil, it will return nil, instead of erroring out as would happen when trying to multiply nil by a number.</p>

<p>This seemed harmless enough but when I showed it to the team architect in North America he said that using try is like introducing cancer into the code base.  I believe his exact words were “OMG make it stop that try needs to die with fire”.  It seems harmless but then other people see it and start to use it and if allowed to continue can introduce a lot of uncertainty into the code.  It is better to know what kind of result your methods are returning.  We then had a pairing session to use alternatives ways to handle nil cases without using try, and here are two of the alternatives we used:</p>

<p>The first alternative is to use an if statement.</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code>class Order
  def grand_total
    if subtotal
      (sub_total * sales_tax)
    else
      nil
    end
  end

  def sub_total
    FooBar.baz
  end
end
</code></pre>
</div>

<p>If there’s a subtotal it will perform the multiplication, if there is not it will return nil.  Since by default nil is what is returned by else, you can take out the else and make the statement one line.</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code>class Order
  def grand_total
    (sub_total * sales_tax) if sub_total
  end

  def sub_total
    FooBar.baz
  end
end
</code></pre>
</div>

<p>What if we wanted to return 0 instead of nil if there was no sub_total?  We could go back to the if else statement but sometimes it can be better to use a Null Object pattern, which is the second alternative.</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code>class Order
  def grand_total
    sub_total * sales_tax
  end

  def sub_total
    result = FooBar.baz
    if result
      result
    else
      NullOrder.new.sub_total
    end
  end
end

class NullOrder
  def sub_total
    0
  end
end
</code></pre>
</div>

<p>Going into the sub_total method, if we get a result from FooBar.baz we return it, if it is nil then we return an instance of NullOrder which has a sub_total of 0.</p>

<p>We then no longer have to have branching inside the grand_total method.  It will either be the actual sub_total or the sub_total on the NullOrder which is 0.</p>

<p>This is an example of Duck Typing.  Duck Typing is when we don’t care what type of object we’re dealing with only that it has certain behavior.  In this case  we just care that Order and NullOrder both have a sub_total method.</p>

<p>In order to prevent an error in case someone tries to call an undefined method on the NullOrder, we can override the method_missing method to return whatever we want.  For example:</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code>class NullOrder
  def method_missing(*_args)
    nil
  end

  def sub_total
    0
  end
end
</code></pre>
</div>

<p>If someone were to call NullOrder.new.whatever, the method_missing method gets called which by default will raise an error.  Instead we override it to return nil.  We add a splat argument in case someone calls an undefined method on it that has arguments.  The underscore in  front of “args” denotes that it’s something that’s not supposed to be used.</p>

<p>In summary, the try method introduces uncertainty into the code because it makes it ok to not know what is being returned by a method.  Alternatives to using try are using if statements and the Null Object pattern.</p>

        Law of Demeter
      </a>
    </h1>

    <span class="post-date">04 Jan 2017</span>

    <p>A few times I’ve been told during code review that something violates the Law of Demeter.  This method for example.</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code>class User
  def user_info
    "#{user.name}, #{user.department.name}"
  end
end
</code></pre>
</div>

<p>Which led me to ask: what is the Law of Demeter, why should I follow it, how do I know if I’m violating it, and how do I avoid violating it?</p>

<p>The Law of Demeter is formally defined as,</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code>A method of an object may only call methods of:
  The object itself.
  An argument of the method.
  Any object created within the method.
  Any direct properties/fields of the object.
</code></pre>
</div>

<p>The above code sample violates the law with “user.department.name” because it’s calling name on the user’s department, and department is an entirely different object from a user.</p>

<p>In general it is better if one class does not have to know about methods from another class, in other words when the classes are “decoupled”.  This is because it makes the code more flexible.  For example in our code sample, there is only one department for a user.  But what happens if things changed so that a user could have many departments and we wanted the only use the first one for our user_info method?  We would then have to say:</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code>class User
  def user_info
    "#{user.name}, #{user.departments.first.name}"
  end
end
</code></pre>
</div>

<p>This seems reasonable for now but what if we used “user.department” in multiple places?  We’d have to make the same change wherever it was used, which would be cumbersome.</p>

<p>So how do you avoid violating the law?</p>

<p>You could make a custom method in the User class called “department_name”:</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code>class User
  def user_info
    "#{user.name}, #{user.department_name}"
  end

  def department_name
    departments.first.name
  end
end
</code></pre>
</div>

<p>Now the department_name is an immediate property of the user itself, satisfying the law and also making it easier to make future changes if we want to change what we use for the department’s name.</p>

<p>One sign that is often but not always an indication of Demeter violation is chaining of dots.  For example “user.departments.first.name” had chained dots and indeed was a violation.  However, sometimes dot chaining does not mean Demeter violation for example:</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code>def slug(string)
  string.strip.downcase.tr_s('^[a-z0-9]', '-')
end
</code></pre>
</div>

<p>The above complies with the Law of Demeter because each method is called on a String object.  And the law doesn’t care about the number of methods called, but the number of <em>types</em> of methods called.</p>

        Refining Searches using Ag
      </a>
    </h1>

    <span class="post-date">03 Jan 2017</span>

    <p>I use Ag a lot to search for keywords in Rails Apps.  However sometimes a keyword is present so often that I want to refine my search.  One example of this is if I want to search for a keyword present only in test files. Ag has a useful -G flag that allows you to do this.</p>

<p>For example say I wanted to search for the keyword “organization” in files that end in spec.rb.  I would use:</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code>&gt; Ag organization -G spec.rb$
</code></pre>
</div>

<p>The -G flag tells Ag to look for the term inside files with names containing spec.rb.  It can accept a regex which is what the $ is for.  The $ indicates that I want to search in files that end in spec.rb, not just files that have spec.rb somewhere within their names.</p>

<p>Another example is if I am searching for a keyword that includes punctuation marks which happen to be regex characters.  For example, I was searching for “.try” and since Ag automatically treats search terms as regexes by default, it will find all terms with any character followed by try, like “retry” in addition to “.try”.</p>

<p>Ag has a literal expression flag -Q to specify that you’re searching for a literal expression not a regex.  In order to search for “.try” you would use:</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code>&gt; Ag -Q .try
</code></pre>
</div>
