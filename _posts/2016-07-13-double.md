title: The difference between Rspec spies, doubles and instance_doubles
---

Throughout the code base of our Rails app at work, we have many Rspec tests that use spies, doubles and instance_doubles.  I found most of the information on the web about them to be very theoretical and not practical.  My coworker then explained it to me very clearly as follows:

1.  All three terms belong under an umbrella term called "doubles". In other words, a spy is a type of double, and so is an instance_double.

2.  Spies, doubles, and instance_doubles are doubles that increase in their power of specificity in that order. So a double is more specific than a spy and an instance_double is more specific than a double.

The best way to demonstrate how they work is to pry into an rspec file.  This assumes that you are already familiar with setting up an Rspec test file in a Rails app. In the Rspec file, inside an it block place a binding.pry.
