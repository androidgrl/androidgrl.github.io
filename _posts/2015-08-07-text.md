title: How to add custom text to a 3D model
---

This is a tutorial on how to add custom text to a 3D model, using Tinkercad's free easy-to-use web-based 3D modeling tool.  This is great for adding personal messages and names to your prints!  In this tutorial I will add custom text to a trophy downloaded from Thingiverse.

Since it is much easier to demonstrate how to do this with a video, I have made a short
7 minute [Youtube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hfQt0NmeYvU) which demonstrates:

1.  How to download the file from Thingiverse.

2.  How to remove the pre-existing text from the model using Tinkercad.

3.  How to add your own custom text.
