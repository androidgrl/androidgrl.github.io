1.  Download Skanect free software from [Skanect Occipital](http://skanect.occipital.com/) note this free version will only allow you to save a low resolution of your scan.  For high resolution you will have to buy the software (cost $130).

2.  Plug in the Kinect to your computer before opening the Skanect software

3.  Open Skanect

4.  Watch my [Youtube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Nm2ufFYNBI) which demonstrates: how to make a scan of a person, how to export it as an .stl file, and how to import the file to slic3r.

5.  Once itâ€™s imported to slic3r, follow the instructions below for how to make a print on a lulzbot Taz 4.  Or, proceed with your usual way of making 3D prints! {% gist 0361b0f2b917a1c322f3 %}
