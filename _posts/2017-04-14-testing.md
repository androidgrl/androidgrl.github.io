title: Determining the Scope of What to Test Inside Methods
---

Sometimes it can be difficult to determine what you want to test inside a method, especially if that method calls other methods, which in turn call other methods and so on.  For example, take the example class **Cake** below.  It has a method called **make** which calls two methods **mix_ingredients** and **bake**, which in turn call **Foo.mix** and **Foo.bake** respectively.

```
class Cake
  def make
    mix_ingredients
    bake
  end

  def mix_ingredients
    Foo.mix
  end

  private

  def bake
    Foo.bake
  end
end

class Foo
  def self.mix
  end

  def self.bake
  end
end
```

If we were to write a test for **make**, certainly we would want to test that **mix_ingredients** and **bake** get called.

```
describe Cake do
  describe '#make' do
    it 'calls mix_ingredients and bake' do
      expect_any_instance_of(described_class).to receive(:mix_ingredients)
      expect_any_instance_of(described_class).to receive(:bake)

      described_class.new.make
    end
  end
end
```

However since **mix_ingredients** calls **Foo.mix** and **bake** calls **Foo.bake** would we also want to test that those get called in our test for **make**?  The answer is it depends on whether these get called inside public or private methods.

Taking a look at **mix_ingredients** we see that it's a public method.  Since all public methods should be tested, we know that we will have a separate test for it and it will check if **Foo.mix** is called.  Here is our updated test file with the test for **mix_ingredients**.

<pre>
describe Cake do
  describe '#make' do
    it 'calls mix_ingredients and bake' do
      expect_any_instance_of(described_class).to receive(:mix_ingredients)
      expect_any_instance_of(described_class).to receive(:bake)

      described_class.new.make
    end
  end
  <b>
  describe '#mix_ingredients' do
    it 'calls mix on Foo' do
      expect(Foo).to receive(:mix)

      described_class.new.mix_ingredients
    end
  end </b>
end
</pre>

But what about **bake**?  Since we don't test private methods we won't have a test for this.  However, we still want to test that it calls **Foo.bake**.  Since **bake** gets called when **make** gets called, we need to add a test for this in our **make** test.

<pre>
describe Cake do
  describe '#make' do
    it 'calls mix_ingredients and bake' do
      expect_any_instance_of(described_class).to receive(:mix_ingredients)
      expect_any_instance_of(described_class).to receive(:bake)

      described_class.new.make
    end
  <b>
    it 'calls bake on Foo' do
      expect(Foo).to receive(:bake)

      described_class.new.make
    end
  end
  </b>

  describe '#mix_ingredients' do
    it 'calls mix on Foo' do
      expect(Foo).to receive(:mix)

      described_class.new.mix_ingredients
    end
  end
end
</pre>

In summary, determining the scope of what to test inside of a method that calls other methods, depends on whether public or private methods get called within it.  If a public method is called, then it will have it's own test and you only need to test that this public method gets called.  If a private method is called, then it won't have it's own test, so you'll need to test what's happening inside the private method.
