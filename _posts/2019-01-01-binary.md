title: How Does a Computer Physically Store Binary Code?
---

Most software engineers know that a computer stores data as binary code, and that binary code consists of 0’s and 1’s.  However, the 0’s and 1’s themselves are just abstract symbols that represent real physical states within a computer.  In this blog, I will give an overview of these physical states.

Before proceeding I would like to give a brief overview of the mechanisms by which computers store data.  Computers use two main mechanisms to store data: memory and storage.  Memory is used to temporarily store data that the computer uses while it is actively processing things.  Memory is considered “volatile” in that it disappears when the computer is powered off.  Memory is what is commonly referred to when people say “RAM”.

Storage on the other hand is what the computer uses to store long term data like photos, music, and documents.  Unlike memory, storage is “non-volatile” and remains after the computer is powered off.  Therefore things like music and documents do not disappear when you power-off your computer.  Historically a computer’s storage device has been a hard disk drive or “HDD”.  Most computers nowadays however use a solid state drive or “SSD”.

So, we have our three main mechanisms for data storage: “RAM”, “HDD”, and “SSD” and we will now examine how they store their binary data.
