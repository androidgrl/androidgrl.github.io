title: How to Raise and Rescue Errors in Rails
---

*  Make a custom error class that inherits from StandardError.  This will give you a more descriptive error instead of raising the generic StandardError, so you can better deduce where the error came from.
 I will use a hypothetical example o an error that is raised when a User is being created.

```
class UserCreateError < StandardError
end
```

*  Each custom error class should have it's own file which you can put in an app/errors directory.
*  Use the error in the model.


```
class User
  def create
    raise UserCreateError
  end
end
```

*  When a User is created, it will raise this error, which will bubble back up to the controller.
*  In the controller rescue the error.

```
class UsersController < ApplicationController
  def create
  rescue UserCreateError
    render json: "Invalid User Information", status: :bad_request
  end
end
```

*  Note the indentation of the rescue is on the same column as the def.
*  You will either need to redirect to a view, or you can return a custom error message such as "Invalid User Information".
*  You can also specify the status code.
