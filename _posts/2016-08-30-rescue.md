title: How to Raise and Rescue Errors in Rails
---

Raising and rescuing errors in Rails is relatively easy.  All you need to do is make a custom error class, raise it (usually in a model) and rescue it (usually in a controller).

Start by making a custom error class that inherits from StandardError.  This will give you a more descriptive error instead of raising the generic StandardError, so you can better deduce where the error came from.
 I will use a hypothetical example of an error that is raised when a User is being created.

```
class UserCreateError < StandardError
end
```

Each custom error class should have it's own file which you can put in an app/errors directory.

Here I will raise the error in a User model method.


```
class User < ActiveRecord::Base
  def self.example_method
    raise UserCreateError
  end
end
```

When the create action is called on the controller, it will call User.example_method, which will raise the error.  The error then goes back up to the controller where it is rescued.

```
class UsersController < ApplicationController
  def create
  User.example_method
  rescue UserCreateError
    render json: "Invalid User Information", status: :bad_request
  end
end
```

Note the indentation of the rescue is on the same column as the def.

Whatever you put underneath the rescue will be run if there is an error.
Here I render a custom json error message and specify an optional status code.
