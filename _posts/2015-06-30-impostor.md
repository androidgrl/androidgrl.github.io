title: Impostor Phenomenon in Software Development
---

This is a lightning talk that I did on the Impostor Phenomenon in Software Development.  It is a very common phenomenon among high achievers especially in open source software.  Covered in this talk is results from a survey at Turing School of Software & Design, and 3 steps on how to deal with it.
